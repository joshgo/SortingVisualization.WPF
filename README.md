Playing around with visualizing sorting algorithms in WPF

Saw these images from a HN post, and I thought it was really interesting. So I thought let me give it a try on my own. I quickly pieced together a WPF app, and some algorithms that I found in Stackoverflow or other articles. WPF is probably not ideal for doing animation, but it was quick to put together.

I'll try to clean this up, and see if I can find a faster way to do bitmap drawing (ie. WriteableBitmap)
